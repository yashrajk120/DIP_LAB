The file DIPfundamentals contains the basic MATLAB codes to upload an image, convert it to grayscale, extract the red channel, and convert the image into black and white.
The second file, Histeq, contains the method to equalize an image and generate its histogram to represent the distribution of pixels based on their intensity values and frequency.
It includes both the mathematical implementation and the direct MATLAB keyword to perform histogram equalization.
